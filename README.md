## Problem statement
1. What is the revenue by quater,month and day
2. What is the Fare by quater, month and day
3. What is average distance cover in quater,month and day

## Skills/Concept demonstrated:
The following power bi features were incorporated:
- Bookmarking,
- Dax,
- Quick measures,
- Modelling,
- Datetable created,
- Filter,
- Tooltips

## Modelling:
:---------------:
